Excel Build Toolkit
===================
The Excel Build Toolkit (*excelbt*) is a collection of Python scripts to manage
Excel macros within a Software Engineering Process.

Excel macros are notoriously difficult to keep under version control. excelbt
allows you to both import and export VBA Excel code from Excel workbooks so that
they can be kept under version control.
